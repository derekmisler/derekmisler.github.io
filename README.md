I am a front-end developer and UI/UX designer living in New York with 10+ years experience. I have a diverse education, both traditional and self-driven, of many different web and application development languages for both desktop and mobile. I am basically fluent when it comes to HTML5, CSS3 (including CSS preprocessors like LESS and Sass) along with JavaScript/jQuery (including frameworks like Angular and React). I have experience with back-end and software languages, too, like C# and .NET, Node, Python, Ruby, and a long history with PHP. I also have a design background a surprisingly large knowledge of typography (seriously, let's talk about it). I think all developers should study design, and I believe having this well-rounded education makes me a stronger developer.

##Experience

**Web Manager**, Asheville Convention and Visitors Bureau, *December 2010 – Current*

html5, css3, asp.net, javascript, jquery, angularjs, node.js, api, facebook-javascript-sdk, youtube-api, twitter-bootstrap

As the only designer/developer/analyst on staff, my job is to maintain our entire web presence. We started with an ASP.NET-backed website, but one of my first projects was to oversee the first redesign of ExploreAsheville.com using Coldfusion, and I’ve since updated and maintained it as the web evolves, as well as creating the matching mobile site and Blogger theme. The site will receive over 4 million visits this year, which is more traffic than North Carolina’s state tourism office. I’ve been in charge of creating all print- and web-related assets for our various marketing campaigns, all of the digital analytics, and two long-form, media-rich, interactive stories that continue to win awards. Finally, we’re in the process of a second redesign utilizing Node.js and MongoDB. One feature of our new site utilizes web-scraping technology written in Node.js that we’ll be using to partner with area online events calendars to create a single, unified events calendar for the entire county.

**Web Designer/Photographer**, Houser Shoes, Inc, *January 2010 – December 2010*

html, css, javascript, magento, php, mysql, photography

During my time at Houser Shoes, I was part of a 3-person team that redesigned their ecommerce website. We created a custom CMS based on Magento, which utilized primarily PHP and MySQL. I also have photography experience, which made me the de-facto product photographer.

**Freelance Developer**, Derek Misler, *January 2009 – October 2015*

html, css, javascript, jquery, actionscript, php, mysql, photography, flash, adobe

Immediately after graduation, I began freelancing. It was mostly branding and identity at first, but I eventually had enough clients needing new websites that I was putting in more hours than most full-time web developers. I still enjoy creating websites for friends from time-to-time.

**Designer/Printer**, Precision Printing, *August 2007 – January 2009*

photoshop, illustrator, indesign, photography, heidelberg

Though this isn’t programming- or web-related, I still think my experience working in a print shop can be seen in my work as a developer. On the web, mistakes can be fixed and I think, unfortunately, that mentality is common among developers and leads to sloppy code. Printing, however, requires an extremely detail-oriented approach as there is no room for error. As an example, Appalachian State University was one of our clients, so projects like the designing and printing of 20,000-30,000 graduation programs required efficiency and communication among all members of our team to ensure we weren’t making mistakes that would cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars to fix.

**Lead Designer/Developer**, Appalachian State University, *August 2006 – January 2008*

joomla, adobe, indesign, html, css, javascript, php

I worked with an intern to establish an online presence for The Appalachian newspaper, while still maintaining my role as the lead graphic designer.

##Education

**B.F.A. Graphic Design**, Appalachian State University, *2005 – 2009*

html, css, javascript, photoshop, indesign, illustrator, flash, actionscript, branding, animation, video, photography

I chose to study graphic design in the Arts department of Appalachian State. I already had a grasp on front-end web development techniques and continued to teach myself during this time, but studying design in an art department allowed me to learn other aspects of development that are equally as important as the tools and languages themselves. The curriculum path I chose focused on web design while also teaching color theory, typography, and layout design in a group setting. Outside of designing for the web, we also had the opportunity to learn Actionscript game development. It was here that I learned the importance of the architecture-aspect of programming, specifically the model-view-controller pattern.
