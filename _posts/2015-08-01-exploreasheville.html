    <p>The ExploreAsheville.com website is the primary web presence for the Visitors Bureau and the linchpin for their marketing efforts. Working with the Bureau's ad agency, we started the design process with the homepage. The design was meant to mimic a magazine layout, including full-width images/video and featured profiles, representative of the editorial placements Asheville receives.</p>
    <p>The new website also utilizes a responsive design, with breakpoints for tablet and mobile devices:</p>
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/explore-asheville-responsive.jpg" />
    <p>Node.js is used to handle the back-end, but the front-end of the site </p>
