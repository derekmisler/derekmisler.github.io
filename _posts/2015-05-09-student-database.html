<p>The purpose of this project was to create a database of courses, teachers, students, and their grades. There is more to this than what's below, I just wanted to show two examples of classes: Creating an individual record and adding that record to a larger database.</p>
<h4>Learn more about the course <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/programming-c-microsoft-dev204x-1" target="_blank">here</a>.</h4>
<small>Student class, which inherits from the Person class:</small>
{% highlight csharp %}
{% raw %}
class Student : Person
{
  public static int numOfStudents = 0;
  public static Stack<int> Grades = new Stack<int>();
  private static Random r = new Random();
  public static void StudentGrades(Stack<int> Grades)
  {
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    {
      Grades.Push(r.Next(50, 100));
    }
  }
  public Student(string _firstName, string _lastName, string _city, string _state)
  {
    numOfStudents++;
    this.firstName = _firstName;
    this.lastName = _lastName;
    this.city = _city;
    this.state = _state;
  }
}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

<small>This is the class that builds the output:</small>
{% highlight csharp %}
{% raw %}
class Course : UProgram
{
  public static void CreateStudentList(List<Student> students)
  {
    // The student objects
    Student student0 = new Student("Michael", "Winston", "Manhattan", "NY");
    Student student1 = new Student("Jalal", "Abramsson", "Queens", "NY");
    Student student2 = new Student("Arnleik", "Gjersvik", "Brooklyn", "NY");
    // Add them to the list<>
    students.Add(student0);
    students.Add(student1);
    students.Add(student2);
  }
  public static void CreateTeacherList(List<Teacher> teachers)
  {
    // The teacher
    Teacher teacher1 = new Teacher("Gerry", "O'Brien", "Redmond", "WA", "Information Technology", 1);
    // Add them to the list<>
    teachers.Add(teacher1);
  }
  // method for printing students and grades
  public static void ListStudents(List<Student> students)
  {
    foreach (Student student in students)
    {
      // Print the students
      Console.WriteLine("{0} {1}", student.firstName, student.lastName);
      // Print their grades
      Console.Write("Grades: ");
      // I'm using the StudentGrades method from the Student class
      var Grades = new Stack<int>();
      Student.StudentGrades(Grades);
      foreach (int _grades in Grades)
      {
        Console.Write("{0} ", _grades);
      }
      Console.WriteLine("\n-----------------\n");
    }
  }
}
